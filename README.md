# stylegen

**stylegen** should be an easy to use styleguide generator for arbitrary projects. There is no assumption about programming languages and only a few ones about your projects code structure.

What **stylegen** ships is an executable that parses your project for configuration files and some templates which describe your work and builds a ready to deploy static styleguide out of it.

## quick start

### prerequisites

As **stylegen** is based upon Node.js, we have to get that installed first. So just download a [prebuilt version](https://nodejs.org) or install it via your favorite package manager, like [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Afterwards the command-line tools `node` and its corresponding package manager `npm` should be available.

### stylegen installation

**stylegen** is shipped with an executable so that can just install it globally with `npm` as usual (the --global flag assures, that the executable is linked inside your path).

```bash
npm install --global stylegen
```

After a successful installation your should have the `stylegen` command available in your commandline which we can test easily with:

```
stylegen help
```

Which should result in an output like

```
> stylegen help
>
> Usage: stylegen [options] <command>
>
> stylegen v0.x.x
>
> a static styleguide generator
>
> [...]
```

### usage

To get started with a styleguide based on **stylegen** we need to setup some configurations and templates, so that the tool gets its instructions of what to build in the end.

At first you should create a **styleguide.yaml** file (or .json if writing brackets is more of your taste :)). The *styleguide*-Configuration is usually expected in the folder where you will run the `stylegen create` command later on.

And to have some starting content, lets create a markdown file in a sub-folder, that contains our static page content. So lets create a sub-folder `pages`
and a file inside of it called `introduction.md`. On unix machines you may just run the following command:

```
mkdir -p ./pages && printf "Some introduction text, that provides an entry to your styleguide.\n" > ./pages/introduction.md
```


**NOTE:** the current working directory, styleguide config path and similar can be configured in an advanced setup.

Lets assume a simple basic configuration as a starting point:

```yaml
# project name
project: Example

# resulting content structure
content:
  - label: introduction
    type: md
    content: pages/introduction.md
```

so our current content should look something like this:

```
├── pages
│   └── introduction.md
└── styleguide.yaml
```

No we are able to run our styleguide tool the first time with a resulting styleguide created out of the given (yes, very simple) content.

So just run `stylegen create` and you should receive something like that:

```
> Cli.command create
> […]
> Styleguide.write: finished writing
```

And in result there should be a freshly generated folder `styleguide` inside this directory, that contains the according generated files. At the moment we can just open the `introduction.html` page, to have a first impression on what our styleguide may look like.

### Styleguide-Config (styleguide.yaml / styleguide.json)

This file must be located in the project root and declares the project settings. It may be either written in yaml format (styleguide.yaml) or as plain json (styleguide.json). We prefer yaml format for configurations, but  you are free to choose json as well.

### Component-Config (component.yaml / component.json)

Component configuration files are usually located adjacent to the component content, but it is not mandatory. Likewise to the styleguide configurations,
you can use component.yaml or component.json files for the configurations.
As well as for styleguides we recommend the usage of yaml as configuration language.

## Contribution / Development

To get **stylegen** up and running for your development, just create your fork and run `npm install` in it.

For TypeScript compilation, please install the TypeScript npm package:

(Because we rely on es6 but want to have the commonjs import syntax to have it running on node, please install the latest typescript package with `@next`)

```
npm install -g typescript@next
```

Install also the Typedefinitions with tsd:

```
npm install tsd -g

tsd install
```

To work with stylegen, it may make sense to link the executable bin/stylegen into your PATH, so that you may call it also in other directories,
without having the need to call everytime for the absolute or relative path.

To develop new features you may want to add a file structure e.g. like that:

```
├── assets
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── atoms
│   │   │   └── form-elements
│   │   │       ├── button
│   │   │       │   ├── button_danger_partial.hbs
│   │   │       │   ├── button_partial.hbs
│   │   │       │   ├── button_primary_partial.hbs
│   │   │       │   ├── button_view.hbs
│   │   │       │   └── component.json
│   │   │       └── text_field
│   │   │           ├── component.json
│   │   │           ├── text_field_partial.hbs
│   │   │           └── text_field_view.hbs
│   │   └── moleculars
│   │       └── forms
│   │           └── search_form
│   │               ├── component.json
│   │               └── search_form_view.hbs
│   └── globals
└── styleguide.json
```
